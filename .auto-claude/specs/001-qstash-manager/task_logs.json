The tool should feel like exploring a well-designed application, not executing commands. Users can navigate freely, never get forced to exit, and have powerful debugging capabilities at their fingertips.\n    31→\n    32→### Key Problems Solved\n    33→\n    34→1. **Ngrok Development Workflow** - Quickly update webhook URLs during local development\n    35→2. **Production Debugging** - View logs, failed messages, and retry failures without leaving terminal\n    36→3. **Resource Management** - Manage URL groups, schedules, queues through beautiful interactive menus\n    37→4. **Multi-Environment Support** - Seamlessly switch between production, staging, and dev environments\n    38→\n    39→### Distribution\n    40→\n    41→- **NPX execution:** `npx qstash-manager` (instant, no install)\n    42→- **Global install:** `npm install -g qstash-manager` then `qstash-manager`\n    43→- **Short alias:** `qm` for power users\n    44→\n    45→---\n    46→\n    47→## Architecture & Structure\n    48→\n    49→### Project Structure\n    50→\n    51→```\n    52→qstash-manager/\n    53→├── src/\n    54→│   ├── commands/              # Command implementations\n    55→│   │   ├── url-groups/        # URL groups management\n    56→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    57→│   │   │   ├── list.ts\n    58→│   │   │   ├── create.ts\n    59→│   │   │   ├── manage.ts\n    60→│   │   │   └── quick-update.ts\n    61→│   │   ├── schedules/         # Schedule management\n    62→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    63→│   │   │   ├── list.ts\n    64→│   │   │   ├── create.ts\n    65→│   │   │   └── manage.ts\n    66→│   │   ├── queues/            # Queue management\n    67→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    68→│   │   │   ├── list.ts\n    69→│   │   │   ├── create.ts\n    70→│   │   │   └── manage.ts\n    71→│   │   ├── messages/          # Message testing & debugging\n    72→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    73→│   │   │   ├── send.ts\n    74→│   │   │   ├── batch.ts\n    75→│   │   │   ├── track.ts\n    76→│   │   │   └── cancel.ts\n    77→│   │   ├── dlq/               # Dead Letter Queue\n    78→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    79→│   │   │   ├── list.ts\n    80→│   │   │   ├── retry.ts\n    81→│   │   │   └── delete.ts\n    82→│   │   ├── logs/              # Logs & monitoring\n    83→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    84→│   │   │   ├── view.ts\n    85→│   │   │   ├── filter.ts\n    86→│   │   │   └── export.ts\n    87→│   │   ├── security/          # Signing keys\n    88→│   │   │   ├── index.ts\n    89→│   │   │   └── keys.ts\n    90→│   │   └── config/            # Environment/config management\n    91→│   │       ├── index.ts\n    92→│   │       ├── setup.ts\n    93→│   │       ├── add.ts\n    94→│   │       ├── switch.ts\n    95→│   │       └── list.ts\n    96→│   ├── lib/                   # Shared utilities\n    97→│   │   ├── qstash/            # QStash API client wrapper\n    98→│   │   │   ├── client.ts\n    99→│   │   │   ├── errors.ts\n   100→│   │   │   └── types.ts\n   101→│   │   ├── config/            # Config file management\n   102→│   │   │   ├── manager.ts\n   103→│   │   │   └── types.ts\n   104→│   │   ├── ui/                # CLI UI components\n   105→│   │   │   ├── prompts.ts     # @clack/prompts wrappers\n   106→│   │   │   ├── tables.ts      # Table formatting\n   107→│   │   │   ├── colors.ts      # Color utilities\n   108→│   │   │   └── formatters.ts  # Data formatters\n   109→│   │   └── utils/             # General utilities\n   110→│   │       ├── validation.ts\n   111→│   │       └── time.ts\n   112→│   ├── types/                 # TypeScript types\n   113→│   │   ├── qstash.ts\n   114→│   │   ├── config.ts\n   115→│   │   └── commands.ts\n   116→│   └── index.ts               # CLI entry point\n   117→├── tests/\n   118→│   ├── unit/                  # Unit tests\n   119→│   ├── integration/           # Integration tests with QStash\n   120→│   └── e2e/                   # End-to-end CLI tests\n   121→├── .github/\n   122→│   └── workflows/\n   123→│       ├── test.yml           # Run tests on PR\n   124→│       └── publish.yml        # Auto-publish on release\n   125→├── .gitignore\n   126→├── .npmignore\n   127→├── LICENSE (MIT)\n   128→├── README.md\n   129→├── CHANGELOG.md\n   130→├── package.json\n   131→├── tsconfig.json\n   132→└── tsup.config.ts\n   133→```\n   134→\n   135→### Tech Stack\n   136→\n   137→- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode, ES2022)\n   138→- **CLI Framework:** Commander.js\n   139→- **Interactive Prompts:** @clack/prompts (beautiful UX)\n   140→- **QStash Client:** @upstash/qstash SDK\n   141→- **Tables:** cli-table3\n142→- **Colors:** picocolors\n   143→- **Build:** tsup (fast TypeScript bundler)\n   144→- **Testing:** Vitest\n   145→- **Node Version:** >=18.0.0\n   146→\n   147→---\n   148→\n   149→## NPM Package Configuration\n   150→\n   151→### package.json\n   152→\n   153→```json\n   154→{\n   155→  \"name\": \"qstash-manager\",\n   156→  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n   157→  \"description\": \"Interactive CLI for managing QStash -

EXISTING CODE IS EXCELLENT\n   - The qstash-url-groups.ts file has production-quality UX patterns\n   - Interactive menu loop, back navigation, graceful cancellation all working\n   - These patterns should be preserved and extended\n\n2. @upstash/qstash SDK VERIFIED\n   - Package name confirmed: @upstash/qstash\n   - API methods verified: urlGroups, schedules, queues, dlq\n   - Import: import { Client } from '@upstash/qstash'\n   - HTTPS URLs required for all endpoints\n\n3. @clack/prompts PATTERNS CONFIRMED\n   - Package verified at v0.11.0 (DESIGN.md specifies 0.7.0 - either works)\n   - Key functions: intro, outro, text, select, confirm, spinner, note\n   - isCancel() for handling Ctrl+C gracefully\n\n4. DEPENDENCIES TO REMOVE FROM EXISTING CODE\n   - BaseCommand (Prefix-specific)\n   - cliLogger (Internal logging)\n   - logStructured (Prefix telemetry)\n   - Prisma imports (database)\n\n5. ALL PACKAGES ON NPM\n   - All package names verified correct\n   - No custom registries needed\n   - TypeScript types included in all packages\n\nRecommendations:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1. Reuse clack/prompts wrapper patterns from existing code\n2. Create standalone versions of BaseCommand and cliLogger\n3. Keep exact menu structure from qstash-url-groups.ts\n4. Require Node 18+ for native fetch support\n5. Pin dependency versions as specified in DESIGN.md\n\nresearch.json created successfully at:\n.auto-claude/specs/001-qstash-manager/research.json",

Interactive-first (not command flags) - users navigate menus like an app\\n2. Never force exit - always allow going back with ← or Ctrl+C\\n3. Beautiful UX using @clack/prompts (same as existing code)\\n4. Multi-environment support (production, staging, dev with token management)\\n5. Start from scratch but get inspiration from the existing URL groups code\\n6. Support both npx execution and global install\\n7. Follow NPM package best practices for publishing\\n\\nTECH STACK:\\n- TypeScript (strict mode)\\n- Commander.js for CLI framework\\n- @clack/prompts for interactive UI\\n- @upstash/qstash SDK for API\\n- tsup for building\\n- vitest for testing\\n- Node >= 18\\n\\nWHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:\\n1. Read the complete DESIGN.md file to understand the full scope\\n2. Read my existing URL groups CLI implementation for inspiration\\n3. Create the initial project structure with all necessary config files\\n4. Set up NPM package configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json, tsup.config.ts)\\n5. Implement Phase 1 features (foundation, config management, URL groups adapted from existing code, basic messages and logs)\\n6. Follow the implementation priorities in DESIGN.md\\n7. Make it production-ready for NPM publishing\\n\\nIMPORTANT:\\n- This is a SEPARATE project from my Prefix codebase\\n- Remove all Prefix-specific dependencies (Prisma, internal logger, etc.)\\n- Keep the excellent interactive UX from the existing code\\n- The CLI should feel delightful to use\\n- Follow the 5-week implementation plan in DESIGN.md\\n\\nStart by reading DESIGN.md and the existing qstash-url-groups.ts implementation, then create the project foundation.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quick Start Commands for Future Session\\n\\nWhen you're ready to start implementation, run:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /Users/daniel/development/qstash-manager-project\\n\\n# Show Claude this prompt\\ncat IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md\\n\\n# Claude will:\\n# 1. Read DESIGN.md\\n# 2. Read your existing URL groups code\\n# 3. Create project structure\\n# 4. Implement Phase 1 features\\n# 5. Set up for NPM publishing\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Files Already Created\\n\\n- ✅ `/Users/daniel/development/qstash-manager-project/DESIGN.md` - Complete design document\\n- ✅ `/Users/daniel/development/qstash-manager-project/IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` - This file\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Claude Will Build\\n\\n**Week 1: Foundation**\\n- Project setup (package.json, tsconfig, tsup, etc.)\\n- Config manager with environment support\\n- QStash client wrapper\\n- Interactive UI utilities\\n- First-run setup wizard\\n\\n**Week 2: Core Features**\\n- URL groups (adapted from your existing code)\\n- Messages (send, track, cancel)\\n- Basic logs viewing\\n- Unit tests\\n\\n**Week 3-5: Advanced Features**\\n- Queues management\\n- Schedules management\\n- Dead Letter Queue\\n- Enhanced monitoring\\n- Complete test coverage\\n- Documentation\\n- Ready for NPM publish\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Before Starting Implementation\\n\\nMake sure you have:\\n- [x] NPM account (username: chl03ks)\\n- [x] Logged into NPM CLI (`npm login`)\\n- [x] QStash token for testing (get from https://console.upstash.com/qstash)\\n- [x] Node 18+ installed\\n- [x] This design document reviewed and approved\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Expected Outcome\\n\\nAfter implementation, you'll have:\\n- ✅ Standalone NPM package: `qstash-manager`\\n- ✅ Works with: `npx qstash-manager` or `npm i -g qstash-manager`\\n- ✅ Beautiful interactive CLI for managing all QStash resources\\n- ✅ Multi-environment support (prod, staging, dev)\\n- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage\\n- ✅ Ready to publish to NPM and share with the community\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tips for Implementation Session\\n\\n1. **Start with reading files:**\\n   - Read DESIGN.md thoroughly\\n   - Read existing URL groups implementation\\n   - Understand the architecture\\n\\n2. **Use the brainstorming skill if needed:**\\n   - If you need to clarify any design decisions\\n   - If you want to explore alternative approaches\\n\\n3. **Follow the plan:**\\n   - Stick to the 5-week implementation plan\\n   - Start with Phase 1 (foundation)\\n   - Don't skip ahead to advanced features\\n\\n4. **Test as you go:**\\n   - Write unit tests for each module\\n   - Test manually with `npm link`\\n   - Validate token authentication works\\n\\n5. **Keep the UX excellent:**\\n   - Interactive-first design\\n   - Never force exit\\n   - Beautiful @clack/prompts\\n   - Helpful error messages\\n\\n---\\n\\nGood luck with the implementation! The design is solid and comprehensive. Just follow the plan and you'll have an amazing CLI tool. 🚀\",\n     4→  \"created_at\": \"2026-01-13T21:33:30.917Z\",\n     5→  \"updated_at\": \"2026-01-13T21:41:46.853Z\",\n     6→  \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n     7→  \"phases\": [],\n     8→  \"planStatus\": \"in_progress\"\n     9→}\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Read `implementation_plan.json` for the subtask list\n2. Start with **phase-1-setup** → **subtask-1-1** (Create package.json)\n3. Work through subtasks sequentially, respecting phase dependencies\n4. Verify each subtask before marking complete\n\n**Note**: All spec files are gitignored and stay local - only code changes should be committed.",
